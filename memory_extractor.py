Rules:
1. Extract facts ONLY if the user explicitly stated something personal about themselves or their preferences.
2. Do NOT infer, assume, or fabricate facts from general questions.
3. If the user updates an existing fact (e.g., "I use Rust now"), set action to 'update'.
4. If the user asks you to forget something (e.g., "forget my age"), set action to 'delete'.
5. If no personal facts were stated, return an empty 'facts' list.
